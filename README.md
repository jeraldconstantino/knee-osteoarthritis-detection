1. Clone this repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/jeraldconstantino/pili-balita
```
2. Upload the [train](https://github.com/jeraldconstantino/knee-osteoarthritis-detection/tree/main/train) and [test](https://github.com/jeraldconstantino/knee-osteoarthritis-detection/tree/main/test) dataset in your Google Drive account or any cloud platforms. 

3. Upload the .ipynb files in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
> Aside from the Google Colab, you can also use Jupyter Lab from the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) software. However, this step requires you physical GPU and consume your time in manually installing the required dependencies.
